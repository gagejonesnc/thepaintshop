                        This is the about us page and will contain a great description of the company, some of its history, philosophy, and beliefs. It's not necessary to go crazy, but letting other companies get to know who they are working with is worthwhile. Throw down a good picture of the team on the right <strong><small>(THIS IS IMPORTANT)</small></strong>.

                        Each of our employees work incredibly hard to put out top-quality product. These are just a few of the people that work for you. Another good picture of the team, or at least the core members would be a great addition to the right, but it is not necessary. However, the four spots below, I do highly recommend you fill in some way. They let other companies get to know who the will likely be working directly with and that can be invaluable for starting to build rapport.
